____________________________________________________________________________

The purpose of the project is to introduce basic concepts of RESTful web services and 
inversion of control (IoC) provided by spring framework. 
I have introduced a service provider for manipulating sample arithmetic operations over
two integer numbers. The project is purposed to be deployed on wildFly AS.
