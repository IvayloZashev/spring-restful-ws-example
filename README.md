# spring-restful-ws-example
Simple example of using spring framework for building RESTful web services
____________________________________________________________________________

The purpose of the project is to introduce basic concepts of RESTful web services and 
inversion of control (IoC) provided by spring framework. 
I have introduced a service provider for manipulating sample arithmetic operations over
two integer numbers. The project can be deployed on Java EE AS as well by excluding tomcat artifact
from the pom.xml.

The service can be tested with any kind of rest client.
